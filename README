usage python-project [options] projectname
  boilerplate automation for new python projects

  options:
    -a    author of the project
    -e    email of the author of the project
    -p    which python binary to target (default \"python\")

python-project needs the author and email to be set. It reads ~/.python-projectrc,
which should just be a bash script setting AUTHOR and EMAIL and possibly PYTHON.

Options specified on the command line override options in the configuration
file.
